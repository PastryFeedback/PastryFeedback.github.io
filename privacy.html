            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="effective-date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 12, 2025</p>

            <p>Pastry (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal information when you use the Pastry macOS application (“the App”). By accessing or using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using the App.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>1. Clipboard Data</h3>
            <p>The core functionality of Pastry is to manage your clipboard history. To do this, the App automatically detects and stores text that you copy to your system clipboard.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> This data is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device (in the Application Support directory).</li>
                <li><strong>Usage:</strong> We use this data solely to display your clipboard history and allow you to paste snippets.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> transmit, upload, or sync your clipboard data to any external servers. It remains entirely on your machine.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Personal Information</h3>
            <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location data. The App does not require user registration or an account.</p>

            <h3>3. Usage Data & Analytics</h3>
            <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect usage data, analytics, or tracking information regarding your interactions with the App.</p>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the data stored locally on your device for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide the core functionality of clipboard history and snippet management.</li>
                <li>To allow you to organize and retrieve your saved snippets.</li>
                <li>To persist your preferences and settings (e.g., "Start at Login", "Max Recents").</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
            <p>Since we do not collect personal data or transmit clipboard data to external servers, we do not sell, rent, trade, or share your information with any third parties.</p>
            <p>Your data stays on your device and is only accessible by you.</p>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>We rely on the native security features of macOS to protect your data. Your clipboard history and snippets are stored in a local JSON file within your user's Application Support directory, which is protected by your macOS user account permissions.</p>
            <p>However, please be aware that any application with access to your file system (if granted permissions) or your user account could potentially access this local file. We recommend keeping your macOS device secure.</p>

            <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, services, or legal requirements. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or by other appropriate means (such as release notes). The updated Privacy Policy will be posted on our website or repository, with the new effective date noted at the top.</p>
